Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: Update cmake_minimum_required to 3.5

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.

   Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
   to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
   to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

   Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.

Upstream-Status: Pending
